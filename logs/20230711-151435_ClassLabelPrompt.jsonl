Ladislaw Starewicz had originally wanted to film actual bugs fighting but couldn't get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered through so he took dead ones and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction. This short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding motorcycles, painting, filming, kissing, and dancing. Starewicz would also make Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933) but his first notable work would be this one.

Although it is a very different film, especially due to the magical world it is set in, HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE has much in common not only with the marvelous LORD OF THE RINGS but also with the very spirit of epic movies.\n\nIt is a film that discusses similar themes, like the fight against evil, friendship, bravery, loyalty, and the power of love. It also immerses us into the enchanting world of wizardry and witchcraft, where the human imagination finds its escape being surrounded by all the wonders of magic. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the main character, is a true hero (so universal in fantasies), sort of 'The Chosen One' who struggles to defeat the dark wizard Lord Voldemort and protect the wizarding world from his evil reign. Although he faces numerous challenges, encounters dangerous creatures, and experiences loss, two things stay in his mind undeniably: the courage he finds within himself and the bond of friendship with his loyal companions, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). That leads him to unexpected adventures.\n\nExcept for the enchanting story and thrilling action, the movie is filled with truly magical visuals. This factor has to do both with the stunning production design and the visual effects. Many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves to be transported into this magical world. For me, the most enchanting scene was when Harry first enters the Great Hall at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, with its floating candles and the Sorting Hat ceremony. The Quidditch match scene is also worth a look as a breathtaking visual.\n\nOf course, there is some mild fantasy violence, like in the final battle, but I don't think that this violence would be as harmful as in many other modern films. Its justification is like any other fantasy's: the battle between good and evil is a fundamental element of the genre, and there would be no point in omitting it. The most intense scene, for me, was the encounter with the troll in the girls' bathroom.
