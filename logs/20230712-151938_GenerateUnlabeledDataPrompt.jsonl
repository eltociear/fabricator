The protagonist is on the run, desperately trying to reach his wife in the hospital, with the police being the least of his worries. The chase sequences were incredibly well-executed, especially the intense scene where he is cornered at a rest stop. And let's not forget about the ending, which left us on the edge of our seats. This film surpasses Bullitt, which was honestly quite dull with its poorly filmed muscle car chase.
